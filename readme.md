# ChatbotBuilder

ChatbotBuilder is an open-source, web-based chatbot creation platform built with **React.js**, **GraphQL**, and **OpenAI/DeepSeek AI models**. It allows users to design and deploy AI-powered chatbots tailored to various conversational scenarios. By defining **chat scope, guidelines, and intents**, AI models can be able to communicate with users intelligently and provide open-ended or customized responses.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- **Platform-based**: Each user can create their own chatbot after logging in.
- **Supports OpenAI and DeepSeek models**: Choose between OpenAI or DeepSeek for your chatbot's AI model.
- **Customizable Guidelines and Intent Flow**: Configure guidelines and intent flow tailored to different conversation scenarios.
- **Intent Flow Configuration**: Based on user queries, you can define different logic execution flows:
  - **Functional Handler**: Write custom code to handle tasks such as API requests, database queries, etc.
  - **Non-Functional Handler**: Provide non-functional responses, such as returning markdown content, formatted lists, images, etc.
  - **Model Response Handler**: Let the model freely respond while setting guidelines to restrict certain topics or content in the answers.
- **Shareable Chatbots**: Once created, chatbots can be shared via links and embedded in other applications.

## üåü Key Use Cases

ChatbotBuilder can be used in a wide range of scenarios, such as:

- **Customer Support** ‚Äì Assist users with order inquiries, cancellations, and general support.
- **Travel Assistant** ‚Äì Help users search for trips, book hotels, and get travel recommendations.
